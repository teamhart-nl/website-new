                            <p>Hi all! I'm Lourens Touwen, I am an applied mathematics student with an active interest in
                                technological entrepreneurship. Additionally, I did a boardyear at debating association
                                Chronos, so I'm always down for an evening of friendly argueing. <br><br>
                                For me, the appeal of human augmentation is founded in my appetite for science fiction. I
                                have always liked considering possible futures and I think it is about time for me to help
                                building one. The recent developments around AI are exciting, but the applications often
                                lack the nerve of being ambitious. This way, you end up with some useful, but admittedly
                                boring implementations. Team HART is a lot of things, but definitely not boring! <br><br>
                                I am focusing on the software side of our development, whilst thinking about (and hopefully
                                testing) possible applications after our Proof of Concept. I look forward to working with
                                this talented team and learning with/from them!</p>
